# App Store Connect APIs Client Library for PHP

This library enables the automation of actions you take in App Store Connect. Its client was modified from [Google API PHP Client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-php-client) and i just added some resources for App Store Connect APIs.

Currently there are some APIs supported: Apps List, Customer Reviews, and In-app Purchases APIs are on the go.
